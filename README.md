# Backbase Front End Assignment: Make A Transaction

## Technology
Angular - 8.0.0
Bootstrap - 4.5

## Assignment Purpose

The purpose of this test is to show off your level of front-end development skills and to show your knowledge of modern front-end frameworks and practices.

## Assumptions

For this assignment, you need to develop a single page application according to the provided design with the functionality of transferring money and showing the past transactions in a historical transactions list.

## Functional Requirements


- Share your solution on the remote repository; i.e. Github, Bitbucket, GitLab...
- deploy to a static hosting platform of your choice; i.e. Netlify, Firebase, Vercel, Github pages or Heroku
- decent test coverage


## Technology Restrictions

### Read Carefully!

- Architect your application any way you want, focus on clean, reusable code. Your code should be DRY, with a focus on front-end best practices.
- We are open to seeing applications written in any modern framework, but we prefer the latest Angular. Explain why you've chosen a different framework in the README.
- You can use any CSS framework, but we prefer if you don't.
- Responsiveness is required in this assignment.
- Create a "README.md" file explaining:
    - how to set up and run/test the app
    - choice of the framework (if not Angular)
    - application structure
